# üéØ Encryption Deployment Checklist

Copy this checklist and mark items as you complete them.

## Phase 1: Setup (10 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal commands to run:
cd /Users/katanyooangsupanich/Desktop/register/regis

# Generate encryption keys
node scripts/setup-encryption.js

# Verify .env.local was created
cat .env.local | grep ENCRYPTION
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Ran `node scripts/setup-encryption.js`
- [ ] `.env.local` file contains `ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] `.env.local` file contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- [ ] Encryption test passed in script output
- [ ] Added `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (if not already)

---

## Phase 2: Update All Routes (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run the mass update script
node scripts/encrypt-all-routes.js

# Check what changed
git status

# Review changes (optional)
git diff src/app/api
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Ran `node scripts/encrypt-all-routes.js`
- [ ] Script completed without errors
- [ ] Saw "‚úÖ Updated: XX" in summary
- [ ] Backup files created (*.backup)
- [ ] Reviewed git diff (optional but recommended)

**Expected Output:**
```
üìä Summary
Total files: 55
‚úÖ Updated: 45
‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 8
‚ùå Errors: 0
```

---

## Phase 3: Test Server-Side (10 minutes)

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Server started without errors
- [ ] No console errors about encryption/decryption
- [ ] No TypeScript/ESLint errors
- [ ] Server running on http://localhost:3000

**Manual Testing:**

Open browser console and test:

```javascript

const test1 = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: 'test', password: 'test' })
})
console.log('Plain request:', test1.status, await test1.json())

// Test 2: Check if encryption utilities load
const test2 = await import('/src/lib/clientEncryption.js')
console.log('Encryption available:', test2.isWebCryptoAvailable())
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Plain requests still work (backward compatible)
- [ ] No 500 errors
- [ ] Web Crypto API available
- [ ] Login page loads
- [ ] Admin panel loads

4. **Register Page** (`/src/app/register/page.js`)
   - [ ] Added import
   - [ ] Updated register fetch call
   - [ ] Tested registration

5. **Password Reset** (`/src/app/forgot-password/page.js`, `/src/app/reset-password/page.js`)
   - [ ] Added imports
   - [ ] Updated fetch calls
   - [ ] Tested password reset flow

---

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing (30 minutes)

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Register new user with encrypted request
- [ ] Receive verification email
- [ ] Verify email
- [ ] Login with encrypted credentials
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Forgot password
- [ ] Reset password

### User Features
- [ ] View licenses
- [ ] Purchase points
- [ ] Extend license
- [ ] Change account number
- [ ] View history

### Admin Features
- [ ] Admin login
- [ ] View customers
- [ ] Create manual account
- [ ] Approve top-up
- [ ] Add/deduct credits
- [ ] Manage plans
- [ ] System settings

### Network Inspection
- [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Make a request
- [ ] Verify payload shows: `{"encrypted":"..."}`
- [ ] Verify response shows: `{"encrypted":"..."}` (if encrypted)
- [ ] Plain requests still work

---

## Phase 6: Performance Check (10 minutes)

```javascript
// Measure encryption overhead
console.time('encrypt')
const encrypted = await encryptClient({test: 'data'})
console.timeEnd('encrypt')

console.time('decrypt')
const decrypted = await decryptClient(encrypted)
console.timeEnd('decrypt')
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Encryption time < 20ms
- [ ] Decryption time < 20ms
- [ ] Page load time similar to before
- [ ] No noticeable slowdown in UI

---

## Phase 7: Security Verification (10 minutes)

### Check Encryption is Working:
- [ ] Network tab shows encrypted payloads
- [ ] Cannot read sensitive data in plain text
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Passwords not visible in network logs

### Check Keys are Secure:
- [ ] `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Keys not in source code
- [ ] Keys not in git commits
- [ ] Different keys for dev/production (recommended)

---

## Phase 8: Production Preparation (20 minutes)

### Environment Setup:
- [ ] Generated production encryption keys
- [ ] Added to production `.env` file
- [ ] Verified HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Tested on staging environment

- [ ] Committed changes to git
- [ ] Pushed to repository
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Verified production works

### Post-Deployment:
- [ ] Tested login in production
- [ ] Tested critical features
- [ ] Monitored error logs
- [ ] No encryption errors in production

---

## Phase 9: Cleanup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Remove backup files (after confirming everything works)
find src/app/api -name "*.backup" -delete

# Commit final changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement end-to-end encryption for all API routes"
git push
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Removed backup files
- [ ] Committed changes
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Notified team

---

## Phase 10: Monitoring (Ongoing)

- [ ] Monitor error logs daily
- [ ] Check for encryption failures
- [ ] Verify performance metrics
- [ ] Collect user feedback

### Week 2:
- [ ] Review encryption usage
- [ ] Optimize slow routes
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- [ ] Update documentation

### Week 3:
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Performance review
- [ ] Consider key rotation
- [ ] Plan future enhancements

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Web Crypto API not available"
**Solution:** Use HTTPS or localhost. Check browser compatibility.

### Issue: "Failed to decrypt"
**Solution:** Verify keys match on client/server. Check `.env.local` is loaded.

### Issue: "Request taking too long"
**Solution:** Normal encryption overhead is 5-20ms. If more, check other factors.

### Issue: "500 errors after migration"
**Solution:** Check server logs. Verify all imports are correct. Test with plain requests.

### Issue: "Backward compatibility broken"
**Solution:** Verify fallback to `req.json()` exists in all routes.
